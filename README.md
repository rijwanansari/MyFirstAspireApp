# Getting Started with .NET Aspire App for Cloud Native Applications
The demand for cloud-native applications has soared due to the impressive features offered by cloud services like high availability, scalability, durability, low maintenance, easy configurability, robust security, and efficient monitoring tools. Despite these advantages, designing a cloud-native application can be a complex and time-consuming task, requiring careful consideration of various factors. Developers often find themselves grappling with decisions about technologies, tools, stacks, and cloud services, leading to confusion and challenges in building future-proof cloud solutions.

Recognizing these struggles, developers have expressed the need for a more accessible solution. Building applications for the cloud has been perceived as too challenging, diverting developers from their primary focus on business logic.
